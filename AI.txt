Neural network
	Input:
		Car speed
		Car angle
		Car position
		Distance to left border
		Distance to right border
	Output:
		Car acceleration
		Car deceleration
		Car left rotation
		Car right rotation
	Parameters:
		Weights and biases


DB (store simulation)
	Simulation
		List border positions (left & right)
		List car statuses at each step
			Speed
			Angle
			Position
		Result

Engine
	Advance the simulation step by step
	Input:
		Simulation
		NN Output
	Output:
		Simulation one step further

Cost function
	Input:
		NN Weights and biases
	Output:	
		1 number
	Parameters:
		Many training examples
	Average of all results
		One result:
			No passing over the border line
			As close as possible to the goal in the fewer number of steps
